Project 64 reloaded
===================
Some good time ago Dean Thompson had a very valuable idea of collecting important documents from the previous era of computing in a "future proof" format and making them publicly available. He created a [website](http://project64.c64.org/) where he maintained the [archive](http://project64.c64.org/archive.htm) of important documents.

Obviously maintaining the website and updating all the documents is something that requires time and may quickly become a tedious job rather than hobby fun. Also - the formula of running a website, which has to be maintained the classic way didn't allow for fast-paced collaboration and updating the documents. Some people have since then accumulated many corrections to the content originating from Dean's website. Those ranged from corrections of simple typos/OCR errors up to corrections of real, conceptual errors. Unfortunately, for quite a long time those updated are nowhere to be sent (Dean's e-mail address presented on the page is long time invalid) and nowhere to be presented.

With the advent of online version control services like Github (and some earlier), things can change. This repository is meant to be publicly available and everyone can clone it, send pull request, etc. I also try to make it "loosely connected" to any person. The owner of the repository is an "organisation" (in the sense of Gihub's terminology) called "Project-64" and can have multiple maintainers or can be transferred along with it whole content to another entity with ease.
